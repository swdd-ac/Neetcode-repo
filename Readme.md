# NeetCode Learning Repository

This repository contains the files and projects I've created while learning from NeetCode.

## Setup

To work with this repository, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Installing Node.js and npm

1. Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
2. Download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system.
3. After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed by running these commands in your terminal:

   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

   If both commands return version numbers, you're all set!
